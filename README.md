I really enjoyed creating this project because it taught me more about dropdowns, forms, and textarea boxes. I've always struggled to create forms in the past, but until now I put maximun effort to understand the implementation process. Also, this being my second iteration of working with @media I definitely reduced alot of code as in the first project, I felt could of been cleaned up a bit. Nevertheless, the dropdowns were also new to me, but after after reading w3 documentation I was able to overcome the impediment relatively quickly!
